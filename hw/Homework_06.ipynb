For example, a calculation such as $(1/3)(0.8) + (2/3)(0.7)$ or `sum([(1/3)*0.8, (2/3)*0.7])`is fine without further explanation or simplification. If we want you to simplify, we'll ask you to. But just ${5 \\choose 2}$ by itself is not fine; write \"we want any 2 out of the 5 frogs and they can appear in any order\" or whatever reasoning you used. Reasoning can be brief and abbreviated, e.g. \"product rule\" or \"not mutually exclusive.\""

    "**e)** Use Part **d** (not the balance equations) to find the stationary distribution of the chain. This will give you a complete proof of the stationary distribution in this case, whereas our general discussion of the balance equations relies on your acceptance of the main [convergence theorem](http://prob140.org/textbook/content/Chapter_10/03_Long_Run_Behavior.html#convergence-to-stationarity) without proof."
